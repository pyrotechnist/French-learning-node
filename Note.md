DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUN + RELATIVE PRONOUN

A relative pronoun and dependent clause can follow the demonstrative pronoun. For instance, you can use que when the relative pronoun is the direct object and use qui when it's the subject.

Celui qui est dans ma poche. — The one that is in my pocket.
Ceux que je connais. — The ones that I know. / The ones whom I know.
